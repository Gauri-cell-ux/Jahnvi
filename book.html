       <p>Happy Valentines Day my baby. October 10th wasn't just a date, it was one of the biggest moments of my life.

        From the first time that I saw you, everything about you stood out—your smile, your charm, and the effortless way you make the world around you brighter.
        
        I love you from the bottom of my heart Jahnvi. This is just a little surprise for you. I hope you like it my baby. I love you so much. 💖

          <p>
            It’s incredible to think how, just a few years ago, I didn’t even know you. Meeting you through Bumble was a moment of fate that I’ll always be grateful for.

At first, I wasn’t sure about how we’d connect, what we’d talk about, or what kind of person you’d be. But I am really happy that I took my chances.

You’re absolutely amazing, the best thing that has ever happened to me 💖

Your words, your kindness, and the way you make me smile is just something nobody else can ever do. I never expected to meet someone like you, but now, I can’t imagine not having you in my life.

Maybe it was destiny, or maybe it was just luck—but whatever it was, I’m glad it brought me to you. 💕

            You are so beautiful my baby, words can't capture how truly beautiful you are. The sparkle of your eyes, the warmth of your smile, and the effortless way you light up every moment. Every little thing about you feels so perfect, so mesmerizing.

            You are truly a masterpiece, a work of art.
            
            It’s as if the universe took its time, carefully shaping someone as wonderful as you, just to make the world a little brighter. And trust me, you do. Every single day. 💕
            
            Your presence brings light to the darkest of my days. The way you carry yourself, the kindness in your heart, and the purity in your soul make you even more special. It’s not just about how beautiful you look—it’s about how beautiful you truly are.
            
            Every time I see you, I’m reminded that some things in life are simply magical, and you, without a doubt, are one of them. ✨💖

            Beyond your beauty, what truly stands out is how hard working and passionate you are. You’re not just someone to admire for how you look—you’re an inspiration. The way you look after everybody and give your best in everything makes me respect you even more.

You are truly an amazing person.

You are the best daughter, wife, girlfriend, sister. I don't know how I got this lucky Jahnvi. You inspire me to become a better person with every single passing day. I love you. 💖✨

You put your heart and soul into everything you do, you make sure that you prioritise others and barely ever think about yourself. You are so freaking smart, watching you grow and achieve so much makes me so proud. 🌟
